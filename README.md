## Description

This app is a simple and elegant tool to fetch and display motivational quotes. The app interacts with a quotes API to retrieve inspiring messages and present them to the user in a visually pleasing format.

### Features
- Fetches quotes from a public API.
- Displays a new quote every time you refresh the app.
- Minimalistic and user-friendly interface.

## How It Works
1. **Fetch Quotes**: The app uses an API (e.g., [quotable.io](https://api.quotable.io)) to fetch random quotes.
2. **Display Quotes**: The fetched quote is displayed prominently on the app screen.
3. **Refresh Feature**: Allows users to fetch a new quote with a single click.
